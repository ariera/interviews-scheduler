# Interview Scheduler Configuration - Complete Example
# ===================================================
# This example demonstrates all available features of the interview scheduler
# Copy this file and modify it for your specific needs

# Basic scheduling parameters
num_candidates: 3

# Day configuration
start_time: "08:30"      # When the interview day starts
end_time: "17:00"        # When the interview day ends
slot_duration_minutes: 15  # Duration of each time slot
max_gap_minutes: 15      # Maximum allowed gap between consecutive sessions

# Panel definitions with durations
# Supported formats: '15min', '1h', '1h30min', or just numbers (minutes)
panels:
  Director: "15min"      # 15 minutes - Quick introduction
  Competencies: "1h"     # 60 minutes - Technical assessment
  Customers: "1h"        # 60 minutes - Customer-facing skills
  HR: "45min"           # 45 minutes - HR interview
  Lunch: "1h"           # 60 minutes - Lunch break
  Team: "45min"         # 45 minutes - Team fit assessment
  Goodbye: "30min"      # 30 minutes - Closing session

# Preferred order of panels (soft constraint)
# The algorithm will try to follow this order but may deviate if necessary
order:
  - Director
  - Competencies
  - Customers
  - Lunch
  - Team
  - HR
  - Goodbye

# Availability windows for each panel
# Format: "HH:MM-HH:MM" or list of time ranges
availabilities:
  Director: "08:30-10:00"                    # Only available morning

  Competencies:                              # Multiple windows
    - "08:30-11:00"                         # Morning slot
    - "12:00-14:00"                         # Early afternoon
    - "16:00-17:00"                         # Late afternoon

  Customers: "08:30-14:00"                   # Must finish by 2 PM

  HR: "08:30-17:00"                         # Available all day

  Team: "08:30-17:00"                       # Available all day

  Goodbye: "08:30-17:00"                    # Available all day

  Lunch: "11:45-13:30"                      # Canteen serving window

# Position constraints (optional, hard constraints)
# Force specific panels to be at fixed positions in the schedule
position_constraints:
  Goodbye: "last"                           # Goodbye must always be the last panel
  # Director: "first"                       # Uncomment to force Director to be first
  # Lunch: 3                               # Uncomment to force Lunch to be 4th panel (0-indexed)

# Panel conflicts (optional, hard constraints)
# Prevent certain panels from running simultaneously due to shared resources
panel_conflicts:
  - [Team, Goodbye]                         # Team and Goodbye share people, cannot run simultaneously
  # - [HR, Competencies]                    # Uncomment if HR and Competencies share interviewers

# Additional examples and tips:
# =============================
#
# 1. For a simpler configuration, you can omit optional fields:
#    - max_gap_minutes (defaults to 15)
#    - start_time (defaults to "08:30")
#    - end_time (defaults to "17:00")
#    - slot_duration_minutes (defaults to 15)
#    - position_constraints (optional)
#    - panel_conflicts (optional)
#
# 2. Duration formats supported:
#    - "15min" = 15 minutes
#    - "1h" = 1 hour
#    - "1h30min" = 1 hour 30 minutes
#    - 30 = 30 minutes (just the number)
#
# 3. Availability formats:
#    - Single window: "08:30-10:00"
#    - Multiple windows: ["08:30-10:00", "14:00-16:00"]
#
# 4. Position constraints:
#    - "first" = Must be the first panel
#    - "last" = Must be the last panel
#    - 2 = Must be at position 2 (0-indexed)
#
# 5. Panel conflicts:
#    - Use when panels share interviewers or resources
#    - Prevents those panels from running simultaneously
#
# 6. Tips for better results:
#    - Start with fewer constraints and add more as needed
#    - Ensure availability windows are realistic
#    - Consider panel conflicts carefully
#    - Use position constraints sparingly
